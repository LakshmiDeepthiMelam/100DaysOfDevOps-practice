📌 Day 1 – Linux User Setup with Non-Interactive Shell
🛠️ GitHub Documentation / README

Objective

Create a Linux user with a non-interactive shell.

Understand Linux /etc/passwd entries and user shells.

Build foundational Linux skills for DevOps.

Step 1 – Create a User with Non-Interactive Shell
sudo useradd -s /usr/sbin/nologin demo_user


✅ Explanation:

-s /usr/sbin/nologin → assigns a non-interactive shell, preventing login.

Useful for service accounts or temporary users that should not have shell access.

Step 2 – Verify User Shell
grep demo_user /etc/passwd


Sample output:

demo_user:x:1001:1001::/home/demo_user:/usr/sbin/nologin


Shows the home directory and assigned shell.

Step 3 – Alternative Shells

/bin/bash → interactive shell

/usr/sbin/nologin → disables login (non-interactive)

/bin/false → another method to disable shell

Extra Learnings (DevOps Perspective)

Service users or automation accounts often use non-interactive shells for security.

Prevents accidental logins while still allowing cron jobs, scripts, or service operations.

Commands like usermod -s /bin/bash username can change shell later.

Takeaway

Learned Linux user creation, shell assignment, and /etc/passwd structure.

Foundation for secure user management in DevOps workflows.
